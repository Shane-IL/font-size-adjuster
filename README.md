# font-size-adjuster
A little util that adjusts an element's font size to fit a certain number of lines.

I just made this for a specific use case that I needed fixed. It only works on elements who have an explicit line-height in pixels or no declared line-height and with a font-size in pixels too. 

To use just pass it the adjustLines function the class name of the elements that need adjusting and the number of lines to restrict to.
